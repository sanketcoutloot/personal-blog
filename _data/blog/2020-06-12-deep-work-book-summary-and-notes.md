# **Introduction**

**Deep Work**: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free free concentration that pushes your cognitive capability to their limit. These efforts create new value, improves your skill and are hard to replicate.

Deep work is accompanied by the calculated mental strain which is necessary for improving our ability.

**Shallow Work**: Non- cognitive demanding, logistical task, often performed while distracted. These efforts dose not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

Outsourcing /Batching shallow work can be a good practice.

Performing Deep work is a skill and can be learned and mastered with practices.

To succeed in any field that requires you to use your cognitive capability, you need to produce the absolute best work you can produce - a task that requires depth.

**Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and exactly at the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of working life, will thrive.

How the Author uses deep work in personal life :

" I built my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot avoid batched into small peripheries of my schedule. Three to four hours of Deep Work a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out I can produce a lot of valuable output."

As we reduce the distractions we reduce the amount of mental energy wasted on that distraction.

# PART 1 - The Idea

# **Chapter One: Deep Work Is Valuable**

As our economic landscape is evolving, the machines get intelligent, and the gap between machine and human shrink, employers are more likely to hire machines instead of a human.

During this change, 3 groups of people will thrive

1. **The High Skilled Workers**: People who can work with the intelligent and complex machine with efficiency and effectiveness.
2. **The Superstar**: Collaborative tools have enabled employers to hire globally. One needs to be a superstar in their field to excel in their field.
3. **The Owner:** The people who have access to money

**Two Core Abilities for thriving in the new Economy**

1. **The ability to quickly master hard things.** Intelligent machines are complex and hard to master plus these technologies change at a rapid pace so this process of mastering hard things never ends.
2. **The ability to produce at an elite level in terms of quality and speed.** Learning hard things quickly and effectively is not enough, you must be able to use the skill/s to produce a result that people value.

**Deep work** can help us to master the above-mentioned abilities.

**How Deep Work helps to learn/quickly master hard things.**

*To learn requires intense concentration.* \*\*\*\*

To master cognitive demanding task requires a specific form of practice - Deliberate Practice.

*The core component of **deliberate practice***

1. your attention is focused tightly on a specific task
2. you receive feedback so you can correct your approach towards the task.

Deliberate Practice can be achieved only when there is no distraction i.e in the state of deep work.

Why Deliberate Practice works?

By focussing intensely on a skill, you are focussing specific brain circuit to fire again and again, in isolation. These repetitive use of specific circuit thickens the layer of myelin (a fatty tissue that grows around neurons, allowing cells to conduct signals fasters )-effectively cementing the skills.

To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction which is an act of deep work.

**Deep Work helps you to Produce at Elite Level.**

*Productivity is a scientific problem which needs to be solved systematically.*

Batching hard but important tasks which require cognitive effort should be batched together into long uninterrupted stretched.

Productivity should be measured as a "**result produced per unit of time".**

High Quality work = time Spent * intensity of focus.

**Attention Residue**: When you switch from A task to B task, your attention doesn't immediately flow from tasks A to Task B - a residue of your attention stuck thinking about the original task i.e task A.

People who do context/task switching or trying to do multi-task experiences Attention residue more often.

The problem of attention residue can be avoided by engaging in a single hard task for longer hours. Try avoiding paying attention to log cognitive task like watching video responding to emails /messages or glancing at Instagram/ twitter.

# **Chapter 2: Deep Work is Rare.**

**The Principle of least Resistance.** In a business setting without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviour on the bottom line, we will tend toward the behaviour/ action that is easiest at the moment.

The culture of connectivity can be found in most business environments, which provides producess ill environment for performing Deep Work.

The culture of connectivity persists in the work environment because of following reasons:

* You get the piece of information immediately when the need arises.
* It saved you from the more thoughtful approach of figuring what you should be working on and how long.

The above points can be eradicated by proper long-tern planning , which minimalised the level of dependencies, hence reducing the connectivity.

In the absence of a proper metric, most people fall back on what's easier.

The principle of least resistance supports work culture that saves us from short-term discomfort of concentrating and planning, at the expense of long-term satisfaction and production of real value.

**Busyness as a Proxy for Productivity.**

*"Clarity about what matters the most provides the clarity about what doesn't. "*

knowlwdge workers wants to prove that they are a productive member of the team and are earing their keep. In absence of proper metric stystem they fall back a system where doing a lot of shallow thing in visible manner seems a better option to measure their productivity. This behaviover can have a negitive effect on the mental health and self-estema of person.

**Busyness as Proxy for Productivity**: In the absence of clear indicator of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs , many knowledge workers turn back to indrustrial indicator if productivity : doing lots of things in visible manner.

# **Chapter 3: Deep Work is Meaningful.**

Craftsman like writers, painters, find a great meaning in their work. This is because they have a clearity about the work they are doing. Craftsman tackles challenges that are simple to define but hard to execute - which require you to work deeply.

Most knowledge workers trade this clarity with ambiguity due to following reasons

* its hard to define what role an individual plays in achieving greater goal,and an individual looses the meaing in work without clearity.
* The noise around most knpwledge workers force them to do shallow work

**A neurological Argument for deep work**

their is a connection between our attwntion and happiess, if we focous on good thingd we will be happy and id we choose to focus on bad/ negative things then our happyness will degrade.

what we choose to focus and what we choose to ignore - have a huge role in overall quality of life.

In the modern world, attention management is skill that is pillar to a good life and ca virtually improve all other experiences of life.

Our brain constructs our worldview based on what we pay attention to. Who we are, what we feel and do, how we experience outside simulates is grand total of the things we pay attention to.

we spend enough time in the state of intense concentratyioin , our mind will understand the world as rich in meaning and importance - hence bringing satashfaction from the work we are doing .

**A psycological argument for Depth**

"the best moments usually occure when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a volutary effort to accomplish something difficult and worth while".

human beings are at their best when they are immersed deeply in something challenging i.e when we are in a flow state, and for that Deep Work is necessary.

**A philosophical Argument of depth.**

craftsmen(musician/painter/ sword maker etc ) are generally satisfied with the work they are doing but that's not always true with knowledge workers.

craftsman do not generate meaning, but rather are in pursute of seeking meaning which is already there. To put it sompaly, A wooden wheel is not noble but the process of creating it.

High level of investment in a work generates a sense of sacredness in it.

Weather you are a writer ,marketer,consultant ,or lawyer : your work is craft and if you hone your ability and apply with it with respect and care , then like the skilled wheelwright you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.

to see meaning from the work we don't need a rarefied job ; instead we need a rarefied approach to our work and executing our newly approached work with almost depth as possible.

# PART 2 - The Rules

## Rule 1 Work Deeply

Even tough we understad how important deep work is their exist a friction between knowning things and doing things accordnging to newly accurired knowowledge.

when it comes to replacing distraction with focus,matters are not so simple. People fight desiger all day long. some common desires are eating sleeping sex and desire to take break from diffucukt task.

we have a limited will power and it gets depleaded as we use it to fight these desires, and mighrt not have left enuugh to persorm deep work.

we can add routines and retuals to help us to transition to a state of unbroken concentrations.

### Decide your Depth Philosophy

The goal of these philosophies is to help you to integrate deep work into your daily life.

**The Monastic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling**

This phylosophy attempts to maximize deep foort s by elemnarion or radically minimising shallow obligations.

the practionar of this phylosophies have a well defined and highly valued goal they are pursuing, and bulk of their professional sucess come from one thing ecxeptionally well. these type of clarity helps them to drastically reduce shallow tasks.

**The Bimodal Phylosophies of Deep work Scheduling**

This phylosopy ask you to divide your time ,dedicacating some clear defined strech to dep pursuite and leaving the rest open to everything else.

Division of time can open on multipe scale , you can five 4 day week end to deep work and rest week day to shollow work or divide seasons like use fall for extram deep work and rest of year for other things.

the phylosophy belives that extream producivity can be achived only if te subject dedicate enough time to reach maximum cognitive intensity .

**THe Rythemic Phylophy of Deep Work scheduling**

the Phylosophy argues that to consistancly start deep work session is to transform them into simple regular habits.setting a starting time every day will help to reduce the friction to perform dep work session.

to aid this one can use chain methos to form the habbit , vissual clues likr this will help you to stay on track and form habbit.

**The JOurnalistic Philosophy of deep work Scheduling**

This method is not sutable for Deep Work novices.

this methid ask advisese the subject to switch to the state of deep work when every possible.

ths abilit requires a sense of confidence in your ability - a conviction that what ever you are doing is important and well sucessed.

**Ritualize**

This stratagy suggest's : To make the most of deep work sessions ,built rituals with a level of strictiness and idiosyncrasy. It resuces the friction in transition to depth.

retuials can be following :

* where will you work and how long
* how will you work, ex disconnecitng from internet
* supporting your work i.e keeping everything you might need to support your session at your dispose .

**Make Grand Gestures (bring novelty )**

By leveraging a radical change in your work environment , coupled with significant investment of effort or money to support the session/task, you increase the persevered importance of task.

some time to go deep you need to go big first (introduce novelty)

**Don't Work Alone**

Most of the revolunatry inventions were result of collabratin between two diciplines. Deep work which id necessary for these kind of work suggest to work alone in long streches , while to promte serendipity we need a collabrative endover.

To solve this conflict we use **hub -and -spoke** model,

where on one extreme we have solo thinkers who are isolated form inspiration but free from distraction , and on the other extreme , we have open areas where ideas can flow openly but struggle to support deep thinking needed to built upon it.

\*\*\*\*Whiteboarding effect **:** Working wit some one \*\*\*\*at the probhable shared whiteboard can push you deeper. the peresence of other part waithing for your next insites can short circuit the natural instincet to avoide deep work.

concusion : seperate your persute of serendiptous from your effort to think deeply and built upon these inspiratin. Even when you reteate to your spoke to think deeply try to liverage withborhing effect , to do so work side by side with someone on a problem, working like this will allow you to push each other to deepth.

### How To Execute these Stratigies

We know what we need to do but dont know how to do it.

We know the importance of prioritising depth but how can we execute these stratagied with ease

**4DX Framework**

**Discipline 1 : Focuse on wildly important :** Aim is to do the wildly important thing that will drive maximum result. Now that we are doing less things we can spend more time going deep.

**Discipline 2 : Act On lead measures :** Lead measure are behaviors/ anctions that gives result shot period. the daster feedback can help us to course correct our way to react the final goal (lag measur).

**Discipline 3 : Keep Compleling score card :** People play diffrent when they keep score. In hour case it could be number of hour spent in depth. It gamify the deep work sessions.

**Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of accountiblity :** Having a accountiblity partner can be very helpful, desicide noof Deep work sessions (or task) you are going to complete and if you fails to meet the end you will be loose something ex money.

4Dx frameword dose not increase the intensity of deep work , instead it creates regularity. \*\*\*\*

**Be Lazy**

At the end of the work day, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning - no thinkiking about work related issues, no tackling of work problems, thinking about future projects.

Adding Downtime can improve overall quality of work.

* **Reason 1: Downtime aids Insights:** At the end of the day, its better to leave some issues unresolved and move to another task at hand, this will shift unresolved task to our unconcious mind to mull things over.
* **Reason 2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply:** Attention is a finite resource , once it is exhausted we weill struggle to concentrate. taking rest between the long stretches refills this limited resources of ours. these resrt/breaks must be some activity that donot require a lot of attention like walikng in nature rather tha walking on a busy street.
* **Reason 3: The work that evening down time replaces is usually not that important:** As we are prioritising deep work, we need to organise our task according to there priority. So the tasks we are replacing with rest are the task with least importance and can be shifted to next day.

\*\*Shutdown ritual :\*\*For \*\*\*\*every incomplete task has been reviewed and for each task you have confirmed that either

* you have a plan that you trust for its completion.
* its not important but it will be revisited, when the time is right.

Some time leaving task incomplete, may leavive the task residue in our mind and we keep think about it we get back to it. To avoid this use "Consider it done" method, it implies , whenyou get distracted from a important task , make a plan how you will complete the incomplete task in future.

planning for specific goal in future will free cognitive resources which you can use to do other task.

Shutdown ritual - forces you to capture all the incomplete tasks and, review thise tasks before making plane for the next day. The ritual ensures no task will be forgotten : each task will be reviewed daily and will be attended when time is appropriate.

## Rule 2:Embrace Boredom

Everytime we get board, we experiance a desire to act toward some sort of distraction. Acting upon this desire for a long time greatly reduces our capability to perform deep work.

**Don't take break form distraction instead take break form Focus.** instead of scheduling he occational break from distratction so you can focus , you sould instead schedule the occationa; break from focus to give in to distraction .

Schedule i advance whn you will use internet and avoie its use altogeter outside this period

to succeed with deep work yo must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli.

***How to work like Teddy Roosevelt ?***

*Figure out A deep task (task which requires deep work), set a reduced deadline from actual deadliie, not to complete the task in this new deadline you need to perform task with intense focuse and in distraction free environment.*

After every session an urge t to opt for distracting behaviour will rise, resist it, eventual it will be easier to get pass these behaviour.

**Productive Meditation:** the goal is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally and focous your attention to the problem you are solving.

Following Suggestions will help you to start Productive Meditatition

* **\#1 Distraction and looping :**

  * Your attention may slip away fromthe hard problem at hand, when you notice this redirect your attention to the task in hand.
  * natuarally our mind tries to save energy, to do so our mind loop over and over on what we alread know, if you find your self in this situation remark yourself and direct your attention towards next step.
* **\#2 Structure your Deep Thinking :** think about the problem deeply

  * thnk about all the variables realted to the problem, sort them accoring to the prority , and analyse how cange in varib;e well affect the out come.
  * once you are done with sorting all the varibles, fingure out the next step question which you need to answer using the variable.
  * consolidate your finding by clearly answering to the main problem

## Rule 3 : Quit Social Media

Calling social media a bad for us is not correct. But we also know that , frequent use of these resusces abour ability to concentrate .

**Choose Your tool wisely:** There are some startratigies that we can use to select our tools wisely .

* **Any Benefit Approach:** You are justified in using a tool, if you can identify any possible benefit to your success.
* **Craftsman Approach :** Identify the core factor that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life . adapt a tool only if its positive impact on these factor substantially outweighs its negative impacts.

**Apply the law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits:**

Identify the height level of goals in professional and personal life. the key is to keep the list short and description suitable high level.

Now list the 2-3 activity for each goal. these activities must help you to reach the goal in a significant way.
